# Thobi's Pocket Reroll Manager

This repo is a Discord Bot written in javascript ES6 made to work with [Arturo PTCG Bot](https://github.com/Arturo-1212/PTCGPB) for the [PTCGP French Rerollers](https://discord.gg/pn6XSn42m6) community

# Features

## Automated IDs from Discord commands 

Using **/SetPlayerID**, player are able to link their ID with their discord account

Once that's done, they can leave the pull by simply typing **/Add** or **/Remove** and it will **update a GitGist** that all players are linked with
As i'm using GitGist, the refresh time can be up to a maximum of 5 minutes

With **/SetAverageInstances**, players can also specify how many instances they are usually running and **it will show the total amount of instances** that should be running actually based on all active rerollers that wrote /Add and are in the pull 

## Better GP management :

![Auto Thread](https://i.imgur.com/rIDDtIH.jpeg)

Instead of using only the webhook channel which is a nightmare to navigate, the bots generate automatically a thread in a forum channel with : 
- The Name and the Pack amount as title
- A **quote to all rerollers** that **were active** at the time of the GP pull
- The image and a link to the source (the webhook)
Moreover, peoples of your group can type **/Dead** or **/Verified** to change the icon from âŒ› to ðŸ’€ or âœ…

## Usernames generator :

In order to know who's rerolling and who's not, the bot let you generate a list of usernames based on a suffix and keywords

Exemple : _/GenerateUsernames TOBI bae cute halp dang pwease noice UwU my that stoopid_

Will generate things like : "UwUstoopidTOBI", "pweasehalpTOBI", etc...

It helps tracking usernamers easily and brings joy to ppl in your group clearing their friendlist and seeing GP with funny names

## Others :

The bot sentences are in french but there's a comment in the code for each one with the english traduction

# Install

- First, create your discord application (the bot), there's plenty of youtube videos explaining how to do [such as this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy5HGvrxM4o&t=134s)
Be sure to enable all Privileged Gateway Intents in its settings

- Be sure to install Node.js 
- Ensure that your Windows Execution Policy is set to RemoteSigned or Unsigned
- Open VisualStudioCode > Terminal and run :
```
npm init -y
npm nstall discord.js
npm install octokit
npm update
```
- You're almost good to go, to make it start, run
```
node .
```
And press Ctrl+C to stop it. 

You can upload it on a server easily, I personnaly use discloud and it should work great once set up

Now place the repo in your project folder and edit config.json

- *token* is you Discord App token
- *guildID* is your Server ID
- *channelID_IDSync* is the channel ID where all the datas about the actives rerollers will be sent
- *channelID_GPVerificationForum* is the channel ID **(needs to be a forum channel**, check about discord community servers to enable forums) and it's where all the valid packs will be sent for verifications
- *channelID_Webhook* is the channel ID were your group have their webhook linked to

After that [create a new fine-grained token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) for your GitHub account, and make sure to only check to read/write your Gists

Then, [create a GitGist](https://gist.github.com/) and get it's ID (the numbers in the URL)

Now you're ready to fill out the last two variables in config.js

# TODO :

Use discord heartbeat to check players rerolling or not, color usernames based on if they are sending heartbeat or not, how many total since X time pack & instances runnning

Filter out all the potentiel banwords from the user generated list and remove then, at this time it only filters special characters
